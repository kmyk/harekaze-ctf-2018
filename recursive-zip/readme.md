# Harekaze CTF 2018: recursive zip

## problem

Do you know unzip?

-   [flag.zip]()

(Warmup, 40 points)

## solution

do `unzip` 300 times

## note

I made this with 3 minutes after the contest started.
since many people cannot solve any non-WarmUp problem, I would like to give them a solvable problem.
