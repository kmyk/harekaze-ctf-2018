# esolang 1, 2

the language is [Lazy K](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Lazy_K), my favorite language. are you interested in it? I made these challenges to tell you about this language.

the translator is [here](http://esoteric.sange.fi/essie2/download/lazy-k/).

## solution for 1

solutions:

-   timing attack
    -   count the number of $\beta$-reductions (or the number of executed instructions of your interpreter)

## solution for 2

for each sub-term, try to read it as a string. in this binary, the flag string exists directly.
